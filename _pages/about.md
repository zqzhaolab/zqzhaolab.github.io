  <br>
I received my Master's degree in Electronic Science and Technology from University Of South China in 2023, and my Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering from the same institution in 2020. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Information and Communication Engineering at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology. My life motto is: Gradual changes lead to qualitative transformation. When you produce enough academic junk, you may be able to develop meaningful models. Sure, right now I'm in the stage of producing junk.<br>
