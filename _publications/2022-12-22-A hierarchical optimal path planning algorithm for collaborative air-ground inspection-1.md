Heterogeneous collaborative systems consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles/ground vehicles (UAV/UGV) have great potential for application in many fields. Among other things, UAV can provide a wide field of view and photography, while UGV can provide sufficient load capacity and act as relay stations. Rational planning of UAV/UGV paths based on actual tasks is an important issue to be addressed. This study proposes a hybrid unmanned system based on coordinated cooperation between UAV /UGV. In this system, the UGV is used as a mobile charging station to solve the UAV energy constraint problem. The UAV is used as a robotic system responsible for reaching the target point and solving the UGV functional constraint problem. We propose a path planning method for the study of two robots working together. A hierarchical path optimization strategy that combines classical and modern evolutionary methods. The method takes full advantage of the strengths of individual methods and algorithms in path selection and planning. Simulation results show that the collaborative UAV and UGV systems can improve the efficiency of performing tasks and that the hierarchical optimization strategy can improve the solution quality and stability of path planning.
