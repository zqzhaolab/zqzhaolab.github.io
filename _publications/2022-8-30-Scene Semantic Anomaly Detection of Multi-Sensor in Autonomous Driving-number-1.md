Autonomous driving is an outstanding representative of artificial intelligence, and while it has unlimited opportunities, it also faces unprecedented challenges. The potential risks of autonomous vehicles cause a significant threat to our current traffic system. Multi-sensor data in autonomous vehicles will form scene semantics. When sensors are intruded, however, discordant elements of scene semantics will appear. Anomaly detection of scene semantics can improve the robustness of intrusion detection systems for autonomous driving. In this paper, we proposed a method for scene semantic anomaly detection. We obtain the scene semantic representation by performing a semantic-level fusion of sensor data. Then, to achieve a scene semantic anomaly detection, convert abnormal semantic detection to out-of-distribution detection. To test the effectiveness of our method, we performed experiments on a publicly available dataset of autonomous driving.
